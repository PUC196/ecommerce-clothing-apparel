# Online Clothing Store

We have built an ecommerce platform for online retail of clothing apparels for men and women.

User-friendly and convenient online store that sells a variety of men's and women's clothing.
With the robust back-end technology of Spring Boot and the dynamic front-end of React, this combination is both reliable and scalable.
We aim to provide a seamless platform for fashion enthusiasts to explore, discover, and shop for the latest trends and styles.

Technologies used :
- Frontend : React with Redux
- Backend : Spring Boot based Rest API
- Database : MySQL

Some Notable features of Frontend : 
- State manageement done by Redux
- Conditional redering of cart and user icons based on whether user is logged in or not
- Backend connectivity through axios calls
- Searching of products by Category
  
Some Notable features of Backend :
- All CRUD endpoints for all ~10-12 entities working fine
- Use of DTOs to avoid exposing entities directly in the controller layer
- Spring data JPA based database connectivity using finder methods
- Field level validation using annotations
